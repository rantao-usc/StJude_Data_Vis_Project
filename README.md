It focuses on geographical location within Memphis, school type, Title 1 school status, school name, and gender to uncover trends, identify disparities, and pinpoint opportunities for targeted outreach and program improvement.

## 2. Story with Data

### Geographical Analysis

Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard for a comprehensive view, featuring a map and a bar chart.

- **Interactive Dashboard Features**: The dashboard allows dynamic interaction, with map markers showing detailed information about each school, including type and Title 1 status. The bar chart selection filters the map to display corresponding data points.

### Demographic Analysis

## 3. Conclusion and Interpretation

### Geographic Insights
- **Targeting Underrepresented Areas**: Identified North Memphis as a region requiring increased outreach due to fewer applicants.
- **Analyzing High Applicant Areas**: High application regions like Memphis suburbs provide insights into successful engagement strategies.

### Demographic Insights
- **School Types**: Observed disparities in applicant representation from public, private, and charter schools, with public schools being underrepresented.
- **Title I Status**: No clear correlation between Title I status and applicant numbers; further comprehensive data needed.
